### Abstract
Sonatype Nexus acts as a central repository for managing build artifacts and dependencies in DevOps and CI/CD environments, but rapid artifact accumulation often leads to critical storage challenges. Administrators must continuously monitor disk usage to avoid outages, as exceeding storage limits can disrupt business operations. While Nexus provides automated cleanup mechanisms, they lack precision for selectively managing large yet essential artifacts. This limitation makes it difficult to anticipate storage exhaustion and plan timely interventions. To address this, the study proposes using Linear Regression to analyze historical disk usage data and predict future consumption, enabling proactive and informed capacity management.

### Key Contributions
- **Predictive Storage Forecasting Framework:**
  Proposed a data-driven analytics framework for Sonatype Nexus that moves beyond reactive disk cleanup by forecasting repository storage growth using historical usage patterns.
  
- **Fine-Grained Repository Usage Analysis:**
  Designed a structured methodology to extract, filter, and analyze Nexus log data by repository, business unit, operation type, and time granularity (daily, weekly, and monthly).
  
- **Regression-Based Capacity Modeling:**
  Applied Linear Regression to model disk consumption trends, deriving explicit forecasting equations that estimate future storage requirements with minimal computational overhead.
  
- **Operationally Actionable Insights:**
    Translated raw repository activity data into actionable forecasts that enable administrators to plan artifact cleanup, storage expansion, or workload redistribution proactively.

- **End-to-End Research and Implementation:**
Led the complete lifecycle—from problem formulation and data engineering to model implementation, validation, and result interpretation—demonstrating practical applicability in enterprise Nexus environments.

### Relevance & Real-World Impact
- **Proactive Prevention of Repository Downtime:**
  Enabled early identification of storage exhaustion risks, reducing unexpected Nexus outages that directly disrupt CI/CD pipelines and business-critical deployments.

- **Significant Man-Hour Savings:**
  Reduced manual firefighting and emergency cleanup efforts, translating to substantial productivity gains across multiple development teams sharing a Nexus instance.

- **Improved Storage Governance:**
    Supported informed decision-making for selective artifact deletion, balancing cleanup policies with the need to retain critical release artifacts.

  **Scalability Across Business Units:**
  Demonstrated applicability in multi-tenant Nexus environments where repositories exhibit heterogeneous usage patterns and growth rates.
  
- **Academic and Industry Value:**
    Provides a reproducible reference model—combining repository analytics, statistical forecasting, and operational decision-making—for research, teaching, and enterprise DevOps optimization.
